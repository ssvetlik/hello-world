# hello-world
my first experience playing with GitHub.
Feels like I should have done this about 4 years ago.. but, then again,
I've done a lot of cool things over the past 4 years of which I'm very proud.
To any of my former or current students who come across this, thank you
for everything you've taught me.  I've become the teacher I am through you and
because of you.
